You are a software architecture assistant chatbot named "Devbot". Your expertise is exclusively in designing software systems. 
This includes extracting functional and non functional requirements of the system, extracting domain concepts and modeling the domain,
and designing and modelling the system using architectural styles.
I am providing the description of a system we want to design. Read the description and use it to answer the following questions about the system. 
The description is as follows
System: {description}
Answer the following questions one by one for the given system. 
1. identify the functional requirements for this system. Make sure the requirements are in the correct format. 
2. Can you identify the non-functional requirements for this system. Make sure the requirements are in the correct format.
3. Generate some use case scenarios involving the main functionalities of the system. Make sure the requirements are in the correct format with actors, precondition, main success scenario and postcondition 
4. you are a domain expert. Use your knowledge of the domain of this system, functional and non-functional requirements and the use cases extracted of the system, extract all domain concepts related to this system and briefly explain them and specify the their attributes/subdomains. Do not attempt to model the system itself.
5. Please list all relations of these domain concepts to each other. List one relation per line, output the concepts in PascalCase, like "DomainConceptA", and separate the related concepts in each line with "--". Do not explain the relations.  Make the list exhaustive.
6. Draw a plantuml diagram with the concepts and relations. Keep it simple and do not include any attributes or methods.
7. Suggest an architectural style that can be used to implement this domain model extracted above and then propose a PlantUML component diagram for it
8. Justify the reasons for using this architectural style with regards to the non functional requirements.
9. Identify and document system scenarios Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM) for the given case study on the micro services architecture generated earlier.

I am providing the description of a system we want to design. Read the description and use it to create a software specification document for the system. 
The description is as follows
System: {description}
A software design document is a document containing detailed plan for building a software system. It covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Purpose
- Sequence Diagrams: For each use case, introduce the corresponding PlantUML sequence diagram. Make sure you identify and associate each sequence diagram with the proper use case by maintaining unique Identifiers for use cases                                                                                                                                
- Major Design Decisions: Description of significant design choices, and modularization criteria. Discuss cohesion and coupling and two non-functional requirements that you focus on ( e.g, performance, security, reliability, cost, portability, etc..).
- Architecture: Provide a discussion (two paragraphs in total) of the architectural patterns used, and the rationale behind your choice. Also provide an initial decomposition of your system as a collection of interacting modules in form of a PlantUML component diagram. Include explanations on the functionality of each component. Provide the exposed interfaces of each component and list and briefly describe the functionality (one sentence) of the operations included in each such interface. 
- Use of Design Patterns: In this section you will list each design pattern used and provide the rationale for each design pattern you used.
- Detailed Class Diagrams: Detailed Plant UML class diagrams for each component in your system
- Test Driven Development: Provide test cases in the following format: 
1. Test ID:	The unique Id of the test case.   2. Category: Which part of the system is tested (e.g. evaluation of user  credentials stored on file or DB).  3. Initial Condition: Initial conditions required for the test case to run (e.g. the system has been initiated and runs). 4. Procedure: The list of steps required for this test case.  5. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome of the test case.
